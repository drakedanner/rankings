  "Plur1bus": "As far as I can tell, this show is about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The hivemind is active and trying to placate and convert the remaining humans. Unconverted humans are quickly told that they are \"Absolutely right!\"\n\nVince Gilligan gives us another slow roller ala Better Call Saul and that is not an issue for me as a viewer. I trust the showrunner, the actors, and the writers.",
  "The Morning Show": "This show used to be about the world. Early on it took swings at the Matt Lauer situation and the #MeToo movement. In its second season, The Morning Show explored Covid, again through the lens of a high stakes news organization. In season 4, this show isn't about anything. It puts characters its created into situations its invented and it expects us to care. There hasn't been any character development and any grounding to real life is hanging on by a thread.\n\nLines delivered in this show bring eye rolls more than anything else these days. It's high budget, well casted slop -- one of AppleTV's first spectacles is now a car crash that you can't look away from.",
  "Task": "Task is up there as potentially my show of the year. Mark Ruffalo plays a character that seems as if he solved the Spotlight (YYYY) mystery years ago and is now past his prime. But obviously (or thankfully), this isn't a multiverse and we're dealing with a fully new character.\n\nTom (?) (played by Ruffalo)\n\nChristianity, return to God -- very much in the Zeitgeist right now as Christianity's Renaissance in the United States comes to its crescendo\n\nThe fragility of the human body was on full display in this show (similar to The Pitt), and hits me in a way that truly hurts.\n\nChris Ryan and Andy Greenwald of The Watch ranked Task at number five on their shared list, but admitted that after the right beer they would rank it number one.",
  "The Pitt": "The only show on this list that can make you vomit or cry every single episode. Long known for their willingness and ability to show things that you can't see on other networks, HBO holds nothing back in this gore filled emergency room drama featuring NAME NAME as it's star. NAME NAME was in the original ER and",
  "Black Rabbit": "Another restaurant business, what could go wrong?\n\nJude Law and NAME NAME\n\nHigh-paced and anxiety inducing, like The Bear",
  "The Rehersal": "After years of watching prestige television, you become attuned to the patterns and rhythm of a story. Watching television with this awareness feels like seeing things unfold in slow motion. Guessing who the bad guy is, how interpersonal dynamics, or even what the next line or frame will be becomes straightforward. In a monotony of retold stories, season two of The Rehearal stands out against everything else. Nathan Fielder keeps you guessing just as he did in season one and in his show Nathan For You. The experience of watching this show was like nothing that I had ever been through before. In a world of known outcomes, Fielder does things that have simply never been televised before. At this point, the end of the show is known... but I won't mention it here because if you haven't seen it you need to. I can genuinely promise that you will see something that you have never seen before.",
  "Adolesence": "We had an interesting moment this year where media captured an ongoing phenomena in such a meaningful way that instead of real life influencing media, we got to a bidirectional space where real life was influenced by media. This four part series was artistically impressive, each episode existing as a \"oner\" -- a single take that persisted through the entire runtime. The acting was strong, the writers feel for the moment was genuine, and the resulting media lead to news stories that prompted conversations at home between parents and children.",
  "The Studio": "Superbad was meant to represent Seth Rogen's 20s, XXX was there to show his 30s, and The Studio is here to represent his 40s. Non-stop mayhem and nonsensical situations that only Rogen, his co-stars, and their writers can deliver in a believable way. Every episode has its own flavor, jokes, and message.",
  "South Park": "Finally back, South Park released two seasons this year after taking 2024. I've heard that this is so that their 30th season will line up with their 30th anniversary next year. True to form, South Park takes chances that other shows refuse to flirt with. This results in an interesting paradox wherein topical concepts are accessible but also totally distorted. This is the only show where I've seen bad writing create opportunities for incredible writing. The premise of Trump sleeping with and impregnating Satan is so dumb that I can't tell who it's for... the idea of Peter Thiel being an expert on the anti-christ and needing to help abort the spawn of satan in an anti-aboriton America lands for me. At every turn, the writers present me with an outlandish premise that is so braindead that I sigh... and around the corner they have a plethora of grounded concepts and jokes that only land within their twisted reality. If you can suspend disbelief for the setup, these writers can carry you laughing all the way home.",
  "Severance": "Milchek is the man\n\nThe band scene\n\nTaking the premise further\n\nWe do start to confront the reality of vagueposting and what happens when you put on the context hat\n\ncontext hat",
  "The Chair Company": "I think Tim Robinson has done it ?\n\nI Think You Should Leave has had many seasons of outlandish and ridiculous situations. Robinson guides us through these spaces and these ephemeral realities exist like flashmobs. Blink and you'll miss it, stare for too long and you'll be shocked, turn away to show your friend and everything is back to normal. The Chair Company gives space to Robinson to explore his persona-esque character in a real setting with a real story. Real is doing a lot of work in that sentence, but if you can suspend disbelief and lean in, you get some incredible situational comedy that lives in a larger fabric or on its own.\n\n\"Are you the guy saying I can't have a wheelbarrow? It's an indoor wheelbarrow?",
  "White Lotus": "Quick let's all rank the White Lotus seasons.... 1, 3, 2.\n\nThat's right. Season 2 leaned too much into the sexual tension between young people who hadn't made the spiritual commitments that matched their real life commitments. Season 3 takes us back to the original ???",
  "Squid Game": "After season 1 of Squid Game became a global sensation, the writer realized that he wasn't properly compensated for his original intellectual property. And to pause there for a moment, it's worth recognizing the power of the Squid Game IP. This was a story that had been written, shopped, and reject for years, This occurred in the 2010s, while the longtail of existing IP was being exploited for everything possible. Avengers 27 was a more sure bet than anything from an unknown writer. Season 1 took the west by storm and it may be one of the first times we saw the Netflix algorithm bring a foreign piece of content to the forefront of western discourse. We saw similar behavior with Adolescence in 2025.\n\nGetting back to NAME NAME, he was very forward with his intentions for seasons 2 and 3 of Squid Game. These seasons were never specced, but they were produced for us as consumers. NAME NAME was here to get his bag.\n\nWhile season 2 fell flat for me, season 3 (as part 2 of season 2) brought things home in a way that drove viewer emotion for the characters on the screen",
  "Wednesday": "I hadn't seen any of this show until this year\n\nI watched Season 1 in preparation for Season 2\n\nThis is the role that Jenna Ortega has been working towards\n\nFan of her in Scream 5 and 6\n\nWednesday takes the reliable Adamms Family IP and focused on it from a new angle",
  "The Last of Us": "A show that is built on top of a video game\n\nThe new zombies are terrifying  --- what are they called ???",
  "Yellowjackets": "Season 3 of Yellowjackets takes us further\n\nFemale lead cast",
  "Your Honor": "Bryan Cranston and these writers saw the power of the Walter/Jesse dynamic from Breaking Bad and sought to milk every last drop of value of out the setup of an uptight father figure in the context of a young man trying to understand the range of his power and responsibilities.\n\nThe show is worth watching, but it's temu",
  "Andor": "I'm willing to get flamed for this take, but Andor S2 felt way too much like the trade war in the Phantom Menance (yeah I know that's sort of the point!). After an inaugural season that is arguably the best Star Wats content (and absolutely the best Disney produced Star Wars content) of all time. Andor S1 was the first time that Star Wars IP was able to bring tears to my eyes... season 2 was a snooze fest. Too many conversations, too much exposition, too much time to understand, too little time to feel anything. Sure, some of the deaths are meaningful. But due to the decision to turn what was supposed to be three(?) season into one, everything felt smashed and unimportant. Andor season 2 felt like reading the last 50 pages of a 300 page novel wherein I already know the outcome of the sequel.",
  "Stranger Things": "There is unfortunate reality about shows that make their name based on vague-posting. A show that started with unknown boundaries has been totally outlined -- early season showed us things that asked us to explain them... Season 5 exists in a world where we know the limits. Instead of learning about the world, we follow characters as they go through task-solving missions. As a show that has dealt with too many characters and concurrent storylines for multiple season, ????",
  "The Night Agent": "Somehow this show got tons of attention -- I hadn't even realized. I clicked it because it was high up on the netflix algorithm. I ended up watching season 1 and season 2 together. While initial situations caught my attention, my relationship with this show fell completely apart. It became impossible to care about the characters or the situations they found themselves in.",
  "Righteous Gemstones": "Another expired show, Righteous Gemstones wrapped everything up this year. An interesting premise had been squeezed for all that it had, and the nearly dried up towel got hung on the hook for us to watch. The actors are incredible, the jokes are funny, but the whole concept is so played out at this point. Danny McBride unfortunately hits the point where you can no longer suspend disbelief and forces you as a viewer to ask \"what the fuck am I watching?\"\n\nJeff Bridges sold his soul for this.\n\nIt isn't funny anymore.",
  "The Penguin": "Robert Pattinson's Batman brought new energy to the IP after a couple false starts following the Nolan/Bale trilogy.\n\nCollin Farrel is a monster in the movie, and I could not wait to get my eyes on the spin-off. This was supposed to be a layup.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that the backstory around The Penguin is simply not interesting or believable -- and I understand I'm talking about a fantasy superhero world.\n\nThe production is top notch, the acting as far as I remember, was strong. But overall, I cannot find it within myself to care about this nonsense.\n\nI felt like I was watching Gothom (YYYY) slop all over again.",
  "Silo": "I simply could not care anymore. Silo exists within an interesting world but how much longer can we watch Common play a character that never existed in the books (fact check!)",
  "Running Point": "Pure garbage. I feel a responsibility to speak to what this show is.",
  "Wayward": "This felt Weapons adjacent to me even if it wasn't really supposed to.",
  "Love is Blind": "We are again reminded that if you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. Entertaining as always.",
  "Squid Game: The Challenge": "",
  "The Lowdown": "High on The Watch's list\n\nInitially seems too slapstick to be \"good\" but I also ran into this issue in the past where I didn't believe that The Big Lewboski could be someone's favorite movie because it was a comedy. There is intention with the acting and medium.\n\nI single sitting watched this one after seeing it so highly rated by Andy and Chris. Episodes one through three had set up, episode four(?) with Peter Dinklage was fun but started to lose me. Episodes five slowly brought me back in and then six, seven, eight were a masterclass in closure. Absolutely worth a watch."
